 The project aimed at using data analytical skills to help make informed decision about setting an ice cream business in Oahu.

This is key in making quality informed business decisions.

* The min temp for the month of june is 64 degrees while that of December is 56 degrees
* The month of june has a stardard deviation of 3.257417 while that of December is 3.745920
* The month of june has a max temp of 85 degrees while that of December has a max temp of 83 degrees
* The month of june has a mean temp of 74.944118 while that of December has a mean temp of 71.0415299

## Summary
The month of june has a higher min temp which means its better for our ice cream business compared to december if we were to look at this single factor only. 

Low standard deviation means data are clustered around the mean, and high standard deviation indicates data are more spread out. A standard deviation close to zero indicates that data points are close to the mean, whereas a high or low standard deviation indicates data points are respectively above or below the mean. In our case a higher standard deviation in the month of Dember as compared to the month of june indicates thattemp fluctuate more in this month from the indicated mean compared to the month of june, despite the fact the deviations are still high in june too.  A low std dev would have also indicatec stability of our temp.

Finally a higher mean temperature in the month of june indicates that its a favourable month to run the ice cream business.
